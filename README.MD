## Daniel meets Project 1


### Trivia Hangman
Test Yourself in this life or death game of Trivia Hangman - where your correct answers hold a stick figure's life in the balance!


---

#####Technologies used

I'm planning to use p5js for the Hangman image and more straightforward js/jQuery on the right hand side.  If I have some extra time after finishing I'll try to animate the addition of stick figure body parts.

---

#####The approach taken

Currently I am approaching the project from first generating the correct functionality of the trivia input (multiple choice) and output (correct or incorrect given via conditional loop).  When an incorrect answer is given, more pieces are added to the man, with a max of seven errors and a max of 10 correct answers to win the game.

#####Installation instructions

Load it in your browser?

#####Unsolved problems

More to come :/

<!-- ### Technical Requirements

Your app must:

* **Render a game in the browser**
* **Switch turns** between two players (if it's a two-player game)
* **Design logic for winning** & **visually display which player won**
* **Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files**
* Stick with **KISS (Keep It Simple Son)** and **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** principles
* Use **jQuery** for **DOM manipulation** and **vanilla JavaScript** for **game logic**
* **Deploy your game online**, where the rest of the world can access it
* Use **semantic markup** for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)

---

### Necessary Deliverables

* A **working game, built by you**, hosted somewhere on the internet
* A **link to your hosted working game** in the URL section of your Github repo
* A **git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted game, and *frequent commits* dating back to the very beginning of the project
* **A ``readme.md`` file** with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.

---

### Suggested Ways to Get Started

* **Break the project down into different components** (data, presentation, views, style, DOM manipulation) and brainstorm each component individually. Use pseudocode! Use whiteboards!
* **Use your Development Tools** (console.log, inspector, alert statements, etc) to debug and solve problems
* **Use your time wisely** You have a three day weekend leading into project week. Get as much coding done as you can over the weekend, and come prepared with questions/blockers on Tuesday, instead of, you know... _procrastinating_.
* **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
* **Consult documentation resources** (MDN, jQuery, etc.) at home to better understand what you’ll be getting into.
* **Don’t be afraid to write code that you know you will have to remove later.** Create temporary elements (buttons, links, etc) that trigger events if real data is not available. For example, if you’re trying to figure out how to change some text when the game is over but you haven’t solved the win/lose game logic, you can create a button to simulate that until then.
* **Don't wait until Friday morning to deploy for the first time** Deploying doesn't mean you have to stop working, so deploy early in case it takes longer than you anticipate, and then redeploy when you have more features ready.
